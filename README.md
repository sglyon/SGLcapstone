## SGLcapstone

Capstone report for physics 492R that deals with the pyhbs library.

## Directory Structure

In the ``report`` directory there are 3 different sub-directories: ``sections``, ``byuStyle``, and ``myStyle``. The ``sections`` directory contains all the actual content for the report. The ``byuStyle`` and ``myStyle`` directories contain master tex files that apply different styles to the content from ``sections``. I didn't like the BYU template they gave me (thought it was a little ugly/boring) so I took the content from that template and applied it in my own way. 

There is also a ``python`` directory that contains a lot of the material from the spencerlyon2/hbs github repo.
