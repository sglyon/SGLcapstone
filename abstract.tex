I describe the tools available for creating a Python interface to the HBS C++ library. HBS stands for hierarchal B-splines and the C++ library is used to represent surfaces or volumes of arbitrary complexity in terms of hierarchal splines. This library is under active development by faculty in the Physics and Engineering departments at BYU. I will defend the choice of using Python as the high-level interface. I will also describeÎ© projects that facilitate wrapping compiled languages (like C, C++ or Fortran) in Python. Among them are SWIG, Boost.Python, Cython, and a new project under active development -- xdress. xdress blends an expressive typesystem, AST parsers like GCC-XML or the Clang AST, and code generating utilities into an easy to use system for constructing Python wrappers around C or C++ code.
