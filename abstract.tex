I describe the creation of a Python interface to the HFS C++ library. HFS stands for hierarchal spline forests and the C++ library is used to represent surfaces or volumes of arbitrary complexity in terms of hierarchal splines. This library is under active development by BYU faculty in the Physics and Engineering departments. I will defend the choice of using Python as the high-level interface. I will also describe projects that facilitate wrapping compiled languages (like C, C++ or Fortran) in Python. Among them are SWIG, Boost.Python, Cython, and a relatively new project -- XDress. XDress blends an expressive typesystem, C/C++ source code parsers, and code generating utilities into an easy to use system for constructing Python wrappers for C or C++ code via Cython.
