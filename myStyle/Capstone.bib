abstract = "The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from \{NURBS\} (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a \{CAD\} (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advectionâ€“diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages. "

abstract = "We explore hierarchical refinement of NURBS as a basis for adaptive isogeometric and immersed boundary analysis. We use the principle of B-spline subdivision to derive a local refinement procedure which combines full analysis suitability of the basis with straightforward implementation in tree data structures and simple generalization to higher dimensions. We test hierarchical refinement of NURBS for some elementary fluid and structural analysis problems in two and three dimensions and attain good results in all cases. Using the B-spline version of the finite cell method, we illustrate the potential of immersed boundary methods as a seamless isogeometric design-through-analysis procedure for complex engineering parts defined by T-spline CAD surfaces, specifically a ship propeller and an automobile wheel. We show that hierarchical refinement considerably increases the flexibility of this approach by adaptively resolving local features."
