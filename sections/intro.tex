    % Paragraph about Matlab, R, Julia, Python
    % With advances in computer processing power in high-level programming languages, many people aren't learning low-level, compiled languages like C/C++ or Fortran anymore. Some notable examples of higher level languages are Matlab, R, Julia, and Python. Each of these languages has its respective strengths.  Matlab is the predominant language for high-level numerical analysis and computation. R is the standard for open-source statistical programming. Julia couples a dynamic typesystem and advanced multiple dispatch paradigm with an advanced just-in-time compiler to achieve excellent performance for numerical programming tasks. Unlike the
